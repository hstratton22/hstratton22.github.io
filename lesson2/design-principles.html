        <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
       <h3> Tesla</h3><a href="https://www.tesla.com/">https://www.tesla.com/</a><br>
            <img src="images/tesla.JPG" alt="Tesla homepage" class="responsive">
            <p>Beautiful use of thirds.  Initially the page opens with three vehicles and narrows down to one visible option. 
         It fills the top two-thirds of the page leaving the navigation for the bottom thirds.  There are three side-scroll options.
        There are three clickable options in the lower third of the page.  It also incorporates the number 3 in the vehicle name.  
        Also, excellent use of white space drawing the eye the the central focal point.</p>

    <section class="repetition">
        <h2>Repetition</h2>
        <h3>Bank of America</h3> <a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/">https://www.bankofamerica.com/</a><br>
        <img src="images/bankofamerica.JPG" alt="Bank of America homepage" class="responsive">
        
        <p>The colors in the logo are used in the repetition of this page.  Blue, red, white and also grey are immitated in the credit cards.
    The cards form a layered line as they repeat.  The text describing each card is aligned right alongside each card.
The colors of blue and red and black are used in the font colors.  The background maintaines the white color.  
The options on the the lower part of the page keep very clean colums repeating the pattern above. </p>
    </section>
    <section class="contrast">
        <h2>Contrast</h2>
        <h3>Marvel</h3><a href="https://www.marvel.com/">https://www.marvel.com/</a><br>
        <img src="images/marvel.JPG" alt="Marvel homepage" class="responsive">
       
        <p>The black background gives a stark contrast to all the colors used. The color palette remains minimal to keep the contrast effective.
          The red in Marvel and in the "watch now" tab contrast well with the background and well the white text.
          All the white text is very prominent.  The text styles play off each other.  The bold and solid caps of MARVEL draws the viewwers
          eyes to the similar styled headline.  Underneath, however, is the only text that isn't all uppercase.  It separates itself
          creating importance.</p></section>
